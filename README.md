# Project 5: Spots

This is a continued version of project 3 spots. Here I have added responsivness to all of the functions on the webpage using Javascript for the first time. Some functionality that was used in Javscript is the use of variables/arrays and using these to create modals for popups. As well as creating the functionality for buttons both on the website and the popups.

## Project features

-Javascript/modals:
